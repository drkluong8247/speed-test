<h2>Speed Test</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Test out a new sports car and a new police device.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player can enjoy a simple side-scrolling fast-paced drive. Pretty much the same thing, but no limits.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Side-Scrolling Car game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the arrow keys to move. Use the Z key to shift gears. Get as high a score as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Similar to last week, but some extra features.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
For once, there's no death.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a world sometime in the future, cars are getting faster and better. Of course, faster cars means it's harder for police to pull these cars over.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You've been chosen to test-drive the prototype of a new sports car being developed by some company. Of course, for efficiency reasons, they're also deciding to test a new device to be used by police. Instead of wasting gas chasing down runaway drivers and speeders, police can set up this device and activate it to stop a car. It functions by releasing a field in a barrier-like shape, which causes any object to pass through it to slow down. Of course, it's also supposed to shut down the car, but that feature doesn't work yet. Well, it means more testing of the speed-stopping feature.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
For people that enjoy racing a vehicle.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Timer is set for 3 minutes. Fixed time
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Avoid the barriers.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the sprites and background from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Borrowed from the Phaser Example - tanks and Phaser Example - Invaders to create the enemies and player controls.
