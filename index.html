In a world sometime in the future, flying vehichles have been invented. Of course, there are traffic laws to go along with these, and roads still exist, because demolishing them takes a lot of effort. In any case, vehicles can fly now. Of course, the first flying vehicles to be created were emergency vehicles, like ambulances and fire trucks. Instead of having cars pull over when they pass, better to just skip over them entirely.

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You've just picked up a patient who was in a terrible car accident. If you thought car accidents were bad before, imagine flying car accidents. I mean, you crash, and then you tumble out of the sky and hit the ground. ouch.
